## Note

- The whole system is handled by `App.jsx`
- `main.jsx` contains all the components
- All the reusable components are in the `components` folder under `src` folder
- All the pages are in the `features` folder
- Each page component is in the sub-folder relevant to its function (e.g., `login.jsx` is in the `auth` sub-folder under `features` folder)
- The users' list is sorted alphabetically based on their first names on the page
